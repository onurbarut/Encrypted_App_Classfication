## Dataset

The dataset splits can be found in `data/` folder.

## Requirements

- python 3.5.8 or higher
- matplotlib
- tensorflow 2.3.2 or higher
- pandas

abstract = { Network traffic classification has become increasingly important as the number of devices connected to the Internet is rapidly growing. Proportionally, the amount of encrypted traffic is also increasing, making payload based classification methods obsolete. Consequently, machine learning approaches have become crucial when user privacy is concerned. For this purpose, we propose an accurate, fast, and privacy preserved encrypted traffic classification approach with engineered flow feature extraction and appropriate feature selection. The proposed scheme achieves a 0.92899 macro-average F1 score and a 0.88313 macro-averaged mAP score for the encrypted traffic classification of Audio, Email, Chat, and Video classes derived from the non-vpn2016 dataset. Further experiments on the mixed non-encrypted and encrypted flow dataset with a data augmentation method called Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique are conducted and the results are discussed for TLS-encrypted and mixed flows.},
